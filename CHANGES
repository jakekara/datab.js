     Using jsdoc-to-markdown for code documentation for now, but not
     totally satisfied with it.

     About 30% through catching up on my test cases, using mocha. See the
     tests/ dir.

     Not sure how to handle the notion of row indexes. They don't have an
     analogy in in record-type JSON objects, since each row is dict-like
     object in an array, and arrays do not have keys, which would be the
     row "index." Instead, arrays can be thought of as having numeric keys
     (the order). One option is to just store the row index in an __index
     property of the row, and consider __index a reserved word that cannot
     be used as a column name.
