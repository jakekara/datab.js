Should the core of datab.data be smaller?

       1. I am now realizing that I could separate out the core datab.data
       	  module from methods to alter a datab.data instance. Almost all of
       	  these functions do not mutate the underlying object anyway, but
       	  rather return a modified copy of the object.

       2. That got me thinking, why did I make it so that
          index(row/col,[....]) does mutate the object? I could easily just
          make it work by creating a new copy, which would dedupe some of
          the sanity checking.

Serialization and deserialization

	1. Make from_object recognize whether a column is called __index. If so,
   	   use that as the row index.

	   This will necessarily prevent the use of data with a column
	   named __index.

	2. Throw error when data shape is wrong
